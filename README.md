# Maze-Solver
A python project written with the help of the pygame library which helps visualize various path finding algorithms like BFS, DFS, and A*. The user interface (UI) has been developed using pygame and the rest of the code is written using in Python. Currently, the program supports BFS and DFS, and A* is going to be uploaded soon.
